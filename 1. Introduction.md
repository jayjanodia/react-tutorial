### What is React?
- React is a JavaScript library for building dynamic and reactive user interfaces
- Instead of creating a tree-like DOM structure that can become complex as we write more code, we use components in React. Components help us write reusable, modular and better organized code. 
- We can build each section as different components and then combining them. React is a tree of components with the main app as the root. 

### 2 tools to create React Apps
1. Create React APP (CRA)
2. Vite. Much faster. 


### Running steps to set up a Repository
1. Check your node version using `node -v`
2. Create a new Repository using `npm create vite@latest`
3. Go into the repository and install the npm dependencies using `npm install` or `npm i`
4. Open the folder in VS code using `code .`
5. Run the npm server using `npm run dev`.

### Package composition within the repository
1. `node_modules`: Where all the third party libraries like React and other tools are installed. Never need to touch it.
2. `public`: Where all the public assets are stored like videos, files, images etc.
3. `src`: Source code of our application. In `index.html` you have the `div id='root'` which is the container of the application.
4. `package.json` contains information of the project like the name, version, scripts, dependencies (react, react-dom)
